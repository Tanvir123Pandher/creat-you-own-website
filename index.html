    <h1> So what is animal cruelty? </h1>
    <h2>Animal cruelty refers to a variety of activities that are damaging to animals, ranging from neglect to intentional homicide.
         Unintentional neglect is the most common form of cruelty investigated by humane officers, and it can be rectified via education.
        Intentional cruelty can include anything from depriving an animal of food, water, shelter, socializing, or veterinary treatment to torturing, maiming, mutilating, or killing it.</h2>

        <h1>Whay would anyone be cruel to animals?</h1>
        <h2>There could be a variety of reasons for this.
             Animal cruelty, like any other type of violence, is frequently perpetrated by someone who feels powerless, ignored, or controlled by others. 
             The goal could be to shock, threaten, intimidate, or offend people, or to show that you don't follow the rules of society.
              Some people who are cruel to animals repeat behaviors that they have witnessed or have had done to them.
               Others regard animal cruelty as a safe way to exact revenge on — or intimidate — someone who cares for the animal.
